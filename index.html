One of the primary causes of Environmental Degradation in a country could be attributed to rapid growth of population ,
which adversely affects the natural resources and environment .The uprising population and the environment deterioration face the challenge of 
sustainable development.the existence or the absence of favourable natural resources can facilatate or retard the process of socio-economic development
.the three basic demographic factors of <I>births(natality),deaths (mortality)</I>and Migration and immigration(<I>population moving into a
 country produces higher population</I>).Produce changes in population size , compostion , distribution , and these changes raise a number of
 questions of cause and effect.<p>
Population growth and economic growth are contributing to many serious calamaties in India .These include heavy pressure on land ,land degradation ,forests ,
habitat distruction and loss of biodiversity .Changing consumption pattern led in demand of enery . The final outcome of this are air polution  
global polution ,cilmate change and water polution .<p>
Environmental issues in India include various hazards , particularly cyclones and monsoon flood ,population growth 
, increasing individual consumption , industrilization ,infrastrutural development ,poor agriculture practices ,
 and resources maldistribution have led to substantial human transformation of India's natural Environment .
An estimated 60% of land 
suffer from Erosion , waterlogging , and salinty
. It is also estimated that 4.7 and 12 billion tons of topsoil are lost annualy from soil erosion.
from 1947 to 2002 ,annual per capita water availablitydeclined by almost 70% to  1822 cubic meters , and 
overexploitation of ground water is problematic in the states of haryana ,punjab and U.P. .Forest area covers of 18.34% of India's
geographic area(637000 km<sup>2</sup> ).Nearly half of country forest cover found in madhya pradesh (20.7%)
 and the seven states af the northeast (25.7%) ; the latter is experiencing net forest loss. Forest cover are declining because of harvesting
for the fuel wood and the expansion of agriculturel land .these trends , combined with incresing industrial and motor vechile pollution output ,
 have led drought recurrence in many areas.The <I>Indian agricultural research Institute of parvati</I> has estimated that 
a 3<sup>0</sup>C rise in temprature will result in a 15% to 20% loss in annual wheat yields . these are substantial problems for a nation with such a
large population depanding on the productivity of primary resources and whose economic growth relies heavily on industrial growth . Civil conflicts 
involving natural resource-must notably forests and arable land-have occurred in eastern and northeastern states . 
Mafia Raj has linked to illegal logging.<p><A href="#top">top</A>

<H3>WATER POLLUTION</H3></A><P></FONT>Main article :<I>Water supply and sanitation in India </I>
<p>
In India just 234 towns have wastewater treatment facilate for 114 cities dump and treated sewage and partially cremented bodies drectly into ganga 
river. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, washing, and bathing. This situation is typically of many rivers in India as well as other deveoping 
countries. <p>
Open defection is whispered even in  urban areas of India.<p>
water resource have not therefore been linked to either domastic or internation violent conflicts as was preaviously anticipated by observers .
possible expectation include sum communal voilance related to distribution of water from kaveri river and political tension sorrunding actual and potential 
population displacement by dam projects particularly on narmadi river.<p>
more then 400 millions people live alone ganga river.as an estimated 20 lakhs persons ritually bath daily in the river which is considered holy by indian .In the hindu religion 
it is said to flow from the lotus feat of vishnew or the hair of shiva . The spritiual and religious significants could be compared towards the nile river 
meant to the asian egyptians . while the ganga may be considered holy there are some probleum associated with ecolgy.It is filled with chemical 
wastes,sewage and even the remains of human and animals which carries major health risk by eiter direct bathing in water or by drinking .

<H3>AIR POLLUTION</H3></A></font>
<p>
Indian cities are polluted by vechiles and industries emissions. Road dust due to vechiles also contributing upto 33% air pollution. In cities like banglore around 50% of childern suffer from asthma. India has emission standerd of bharat stage II from vechiles since 2005 <p>
one of the biggest cause of air pollution in India is formed from the transport system.100 of millions of old diesel engine continiously buring away diesel which has any thing between 150 to 190 times the amount of sulphur out European diesel has. Ofcourse the biggest are in the big cities where there are huge concentration of vechile.on the positive side the government apperstp ahve noticed this massive probleum and the associted health risk for its people and is slowly but surely taking steps.the first of which was in 2001 when it ruled that its entire public transport ystem excluding the trains ,be converted from diesel to compressed gas.Electic rickshaws are beem designed andn will be subsided by the government but the supposed ban on the cycle rickshaws in delhi will require a huge increased on the relience on other methods of tansport mainly those with engine <p>
It alo appered that the excessive polution was having an adverse effects on the taj mahal after a court ruling all transport in the area was shut down shotly followed by closing of all industrial in the area. the air pollution in the big cities is rising to such and extends that it is oe 2.3 higher then the amount recommended by WHO 
<p>
Environmental polution is a  global probleum and the whole humanity is wroied as to how to control it. Each nation is trying its best to reduce the poluting factors tosave human life. with the new advnced anlyeses through satelite man has been able to find the causes of possible depletion of ozone layer and its consequent effects.They talk about pollution through excessive refrigration,fuel buning ,imdustrial pollution and other such factor, but no buddy has been able to imagine about the pollution being caused by the death bodies when consigned for cremation in  noscintific manner. we cry about the probleums but noprobleum can be solved unless you provide an alternate or solution to it. The four areas identified for pollution namely Air, Water, Earth and Space, have been well researched and discovered. The visible areas to the human eye- Earth and Water, catch easily the attention but the other two areas of Air and Space, which are invisible to the common eyesight, are under the constant study,vigil and remedial efforts. <P><A href="#top">top</A>

<H3> NOISE AND LAND POLLUTION</H3></A></FONT><p>
The supreme court of india gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.<P>
unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollutuion in residential areas.<P>
Land pollution in India is due to pesticides and fertilisers as well as corrosion<P>

India lying within the Indomalaya ecozone, hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian,12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptillian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species. <P>

In resent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with over 500 wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts 14 biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; 25 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention. <P><A href="#top">Top</A>
